%% @doc This FSM acts as a Riak Pipe sink, and dumbly accumulates
%% messages received from the pipe, until it is asked to send them to
%% its owner. The owner is whatever process started this FSM.

%% This FSM will speak both `raw' and `fsm' sink types (it
%% answers appropriately to each, without parameterization).

%% The FSM enforces a soft cap on the number of results and logs
%% accumulated when receiving `fsm' sink type messages. When the
%% number of results+logs that have been delivered exceeds the cap
%% between calls to {@link next/1}, the sink stops delivering result
%% acks to workers. The value of this cap can be specified by
%% including a `buffer' property in the `Options' parameter of {@link
%% start/2}, or by setting the `mrc_sink_buffer' environment variable
%% in the `riak_kv' application. If neither settings is specified, or
%% they are not specified as non-negative integers, the default
%% (currently 1000) is used.

%% Messages are delivered to the owners as an erlang message that is a
%% `#kv_mrc_pipe{}' record. The `logs' field is a list of log messages
%% received, ordered oldest to youngest, each having the form
%% `{PhaseId, Message}'. The `results' field is an orddict keyed by
%% `PhaseId', with each value being a list of results received from
%% that phase, ordered oldest to youngest. The `ref' field is the
%% reference from the `#pipe{}' record. The `done' field is `true' if
%% the `eoi' message has been received, or `false' otherwise.

%% There should be three states: `which_pipe', `collect_output', and
%% `send_output'.

%% The FSM starts in `which_pipe', and waits there until it
%% is told which pipe to expect output from.

%% From `which_pipe', the FSM moves to `collect_output'. While in
%% `collect_output', the FSM simply collects `#pipe_log{}',
%% `#pipe_result{}', and `#pipe_eoi{}' messages.

%% If the FSM has received logs, results, or the eoi before it
%% receives a `next' event, it sends everything it has accumulated to
%% the owner, wrapped in a `#kv_mrc_sink{}' record, clears its buffers,
%% and returns to collecting pipe messages.

%% If the FSM has not received any logs, results, or the eoi before it
%% receives a `next' event, it enters the `send_ouput' state. As soon
%% as the FSM receives any log, result, or eoi message in the
%% `send_output' state, it sends that message to the owner process,
%% and then returns to the `collect_output' state.

%% The FSM only exits on its own in three cases. The first is when its
%% owner exits. The second is when the builder of the pipe for which
%% it is consuming messages exits abnormally. The third is after it
%% delivers the a `#kv_mrc_sink{}' in which it has marked
%% `done=true'.
